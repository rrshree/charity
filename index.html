					Even small donations have an impact.
				</h2>
				<p>
					When considering poverty in the developing world, many people feel
					deep sorrow but conclude that there is nothing we can do. The scale of
					poverty is immense and we seem powerless to stop it. Such despair is
					understandable, but the facts tell a very different story. While
					poverty is indeed extreme and widespread, it is easy to forget just
					how many people there are in the developed world, and how powerful our
					pocket change can become when pooled together.
				</p>
				<p>
					When giving to an effective charity, the size of your donation
					directly correlates with the number of people you are able to help.
					But you don’t have to be a millionaire to make a significant
					difference;

				<p>
					Small donations collectively have a huge impact and regardless of the
					size of your individual gift, it will make a difference. Whether it’s
					students pooling change and efforts for families with children facing
					cancer in South Carolina, educating children in Africa or supporting
					the nonprofit that is near and dear to you, every donation will truly
					make a difference. Just ask the Salvation Army bell ringer if your
					spare change has an impact.

					Giving benefits the world’s neediest people.
				</h2>
				<p>
					A plethora of options exist today for ordinary people with a little
					bit of extra means to help the poor: donating a yak to a Nepalese
					family in the name of the “rich uncle who has everything,” making a
					microfinance loan to a Nigerian cobbler through Kiva, sponsoring a
					child in virtually any developing country in the world. Courtesy of
					the web, today it is not just big governments and multinational
					organizations that do all of the heavy giving. Ordinary people give to
					the overseas poor now more than ever.

							>1. Providing Clean Water to Rural Villages. (Average Rating:
							8.31)</strong
						>
						A colleague of mine at USF had his large undergraduate global
						economics class take the poll as well. Even the undergrads came up
						with the same answer for the #1 ranking, so it seems you don’t have
						to be a development economist to get this one. A million children
						die from drinking unclean water each year. One famous WHO study
						found clean water in a rural village reduces infant mortality by 35%
						to 50% at a cost of roughly $10 per person per year. Bang for the
						buck, clean water is hard to beat.
					</li>
					<li>
						2. De-worming Treatments for Children. (Average Rating: 7.81) This
						one was probably ranked high for three reasons. First, because
						de-worming is so effective at a medical level, it’s cheap, and also
						because this early intervention was the subject of one of the most
						famous early randomized trials. Miguel and Kremer’s celebrated study
						found that regular de-worming treatment in worm-infested areas of
						the developing world could reduce school absenteeism by 25% at a
						cost of $0.50 per year.
					</li>
					<li>
						3. Child Sponsorship. (Average Rating: 6.86) Paul Glewwe, Laine
						Rutledge, and I did a BASIS-sponsored study on the long-term impacts
						of Compassion International’s child sponsorship program. We used a
						regression discontinuity/IV framework based on age eligibility at
						program rollout that examined adult life outcomes for children who
						were sponsored in six countries through Compassion’s program during
						the 1980s and 1990s. The adults who as children providentially lay
						on the right side of the age-eligibility cutoff were more likely to
						complete secondary school, have a white-collar job, marry and have
						children later, and have a house with electricity.
					</li>
					<li>
						4. Microfinance. (Average Rating: 4.19) Development economists now
						are nearly all aware of one major fact about microfinance: it’s
						astounding growth over the years is significantly larger than its
						impact. Most of the recent studies of microfinance using RCTs,
						including the relatively recent 2011 papers by Duflo et al. study in
						Morocco, and the new Attanasio et al. study in Mongolia find modest
						impacts: increases in entrepreneurialism and business investment,
						but little or no increase in income. Microfinance clearly exhibits
						some modest positive impacts, but it isn’t the silver bullet in the
						heart of poverty some had hoped it might be.
					</li>
					<li>
						5. Laptops for Kids. (Average Rating: 1.80) The One Laptop per Child
						program gives away laptops to kids in developing countries who have
						at least a thousand more pressing needs. The bang for the buck on
						this one is at best a whimper, at worst inaudible. A recent study
						presented at the NEUDC by Cristia et al. at the Inter-American
						Development Bank evaluated the impact of the One Laptop per Child
						program in Peru, finding zero impact on learning or on expectations
						about future education.

				<p>
					Effective interventions can break the cycle of poverty for the world’s
					neediest people. Preventing and fighting diseases can keep children
					healthy and in school. Effective healthcare allows parents to continue
					supporting their families when they might otherwise have to care for
					sick children or themselves be disabled by debilitating illness. Aid
					provides those living in extreme poverty with the essential resources
					necessary to attain a better standard of living.
				</p>
				<p>
					Poverty is a problem that has proven solutions, and giving plays a
					crucial role in combating extreme poverty. According to the United
					Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), dramatically fewer people
					today are living in extreme poverty than just a few decades ago.
				</p>
				<h3>We have the financial resources to combat poverty.</h3>
				<p>
					When we read statistics about the number of people living in extreme
					poverty, the scale of suffering can seem immense. But the facts about
					aid and relief distribution tell a very different story. While 767
					million people live on less than $1.90 a day, those of us living in
					the developed world have significant collective resources at our
					disposal. Focusing solely on the U.S., it would take just $3 per
					American citizen to come up with a billion dollars of aid money. How
					much money per year would we need to meet the most basic health and
					nutritional requirements of the world’s neediest people?
				</p>
				<p>
					There is enough money in the developed world to easily meet the most
					basic needs of the world’s poorest people, many times over. It is
					possible to give without diverting resources from educational or
					healthcare programs in the developed world, and without making any
					significant impact on the quality of life for potential donors.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="page-section">
				<h2 class="section-title" id="latest-news">Giving makes us happier.</h2>
				<p>
					Research has shown that spending money on ourselves does not
					significantly increase our sense of happiness or wellbeing. A Harvard
					Business School study suggests that giving to others is directly
					correlated with an increased sense of happiness. The Harvard
					researchers write: “Happier people give more and giving makes people
					happier, such that happiness and giving may operate in a positive
					feedback loop.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Other studies have shown that people experience pleasure when they see
					money go to charity—even if this money isn’t their own. People
					experience the most pleasure, however, when they give directly to
					charity themselves.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Giving brings us closer to creating the world we would want to live
					in.
				</h3>
				<p>
					The 700 million of us living on less than $2 a day account for roughly
					10% of the human population. Even though all of us would like to think
					that our sense of wellbeing, political freedom, and personal
					accomplishments are the results of our own efforts, we know that none
					of these realities are possible without certain essential material
					conditions: food, clean water, shelter, basic healthcare, and
					political stability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you comfortable living in a world where there is about a 10%
					chance that a newborn child will be one of the 700 million people
					living on less than $2 a day without access to some of these
					necessities? Inequality leads to violent crime; they are not only
					correlated, but a distinct causal relationship has been found time and
					again across the world and within countries with varying levels of
					equality. Giving lets us work toward building a better world—one
					that’s safer, healthier, more stable, and happier for all of us.
